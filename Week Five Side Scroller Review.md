## Summary
This game is a 2d side scroller puzzle/shoot em up game.  For those of you who remember playing Metroid on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), this game immediately invokes visual nostalgia.  The pixel art and the ability to roll into a ball is where the similarities end unfortunately.

Your objective is to make it through a number of levels and subsections as fast as you can.  That is about it as the story and purpose are pretty weak.  During your travels you will encounter enemies of all shapes and sizes.  The avatar can run, jump, jump off walls, turn into a ball and move faster and into smaller places, etc.  Advanced techniques like jumping and then turning into a ball for a longer jump are available as well.  Your default attack is your kick, but that is all but useless for many of the enemies that you will encounter.  

Eventually, you encounter machines that allow you to select what weapon to use for that level.  The developer gives the player pretty much free reign to pick their weapon of choice.  The player uses the mouse to aim and fire whatever weapon they choose.  Examples of weapons are the Railgun, Blitz gun, rocket launcher, etc.  

One thing you notice immediately is that you will die many times over.  I found myself dying from the very first enemies encountered at least 4 times before I figured out that my biggest asset would be just trying to get past them.  This game is very unforgiving in that regard.  On the positive side it does autosave and allow you to restart from relatively close to wherever your avatar perished.

## Final Thoughts
I give this title a 5 out of 10.  I was immediately put off by the annoying deaths at the outset of the game.  The pixel art is nice enough, but there is no real visual distinction between friend and foe.  Many times you are left wondering if you are seeing part of the background or something that can actually hurt you.  The game balance is all over the place.  For example there are swarms of floating exploding drones that attack you and in an early level.  The sheer number and speed of the enemies make it so that almost every weapon you choose is wrong.  I found one that has rapid fire like the Blitz gun to finally make it through.  This is just one example where, at an early stage, you are faced with a very tough obstacle.  There is little scaling of difficulty.

You die, try again, rinse repeat ad infinitum.  It literally became a chore for me to continue playing this game no matter how far I was able to progress.  The music was interesting at first, but became a bit monotonous.  A game like this requires precise and tight controls.  The game controls are sloppy and add to your death count.  For a free indy game it is fine.  If you as a player are into hardcore twitchy side scrollers with lots of player death, lack of balance, and little story, this game is for you.  Personally, I didnâ€™t even find this game fun after a while.  Its resemblance to Metroid was all that it had going for it.

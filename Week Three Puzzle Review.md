## Summary
Gems of War is a puzzle game that follows the Match 3 format.  This is where you can match 3 or more gems or items of the same type to gain points.  The interesting part of this game is the added twists to the gameplay.  The setting is high fantasy complete with magic spells and monsters of all types. 

You begin your quest by creating your character.  The game provides you with a relatively robust selections for character portraits.  You may also change the hero's look later on for free which is a nice perk.  Once you are done with character creation you go through the tutorial. The tutorial isn't boring and is quite useful.  It helps you understand the strategy of combat.  There are colored gems that represent an energy type, like fire or water.  Those crystals provide energy to your character's spells and powers.  So for example, if your character needs 8 water orbs to activate its freeze power, the more blue water orbs you destroy the better.  If you destroy 4 in a row, an L, or a T, you get to go again.  As you play skull crystals will also appear.  Destroy three of these or more and you will attack the enemy.

This leads to the next interesting aspect of this game.  Each player has a hero character that plays and can use weapons, but you also need 3 other support creatures.  During the tutorial you are given these characters as you progress.  Each support character has its own unique abilities that are powered by different colored gems.  It is up to you to strategize how best to employ them.  At the end of the tutorial, you are given a baby dragon card as well as a random legendary card.  Both will serve as the mainstay of your fighting force as you attempt to level up.

After the tutorial, you notice that there is a lot more to this game than meets the eye.  You have the ability to use your gold to unlock new kingdoms.  If you follow the questlines for each kingdom, you are given rare cards, treasure maps, and access to unique character classes.  Yes, this game also has character classes that you can seek out and use during battle.  You can level up your kingdoms, level up your characters, merge characters to strengthen them, gain points to distribute to the various affinities such as earth, fire, water, etc.  As your affinities level up you gain new weapons to use on your quests.  You can join a guild for quests and bonuses there.  You have daily, monthly, and seasonal quests. There is an arena, player vs player, and more.

## Final Thoughts
I gave this title 8 out of 10 (would have been a 9). I subtracted 1 star for the absolutely unplayable PC version of the game.  it is atrocious, but the phone version works like a champ. The game is addictive, fun, and rewarding.  You aren't given stamina or anything like that to limit how much you quest and play.  In essence, your improvement is based on how much time you put into it.  That is not to say you don't have currency and such to pay attention to.  The game uses keys to obtain new support characters, souls to level up, and gold to expand and improve kingdoms.  The community on the in-game chat is very helpful.  The artwork is solid as are the music and sound effects.  This game surprised me in that I never thought I would like a puzzle game as much as I do this one.  Obviously there are pay to win aspects of the game, but not in the sense that you have to use it.  You can simply enjoy the game and earn all the currency through gameplay.  I have to give the game creators their due for combining aspects of RPG, Card Games, Kingdom Buidling, and Match 3 puzzles into one fun experience.

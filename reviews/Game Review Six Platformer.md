## Summary
Brawlhalla is a 2d platform fighter that resembles the Super Smash Bros line.  The setting is one of a mythical Valhalla type of world where champion warriors from every culture come to battle.  This eternal arena boasts 44 unlockable characters, a myriad of maps, and differing gameplay modes.  The gameplay modes are as follows: Online Ranked 1v1, online ranked 2v2, 4 player online free for all, 8 player 4 v 4 free for all, local free for all, local custom teams, local single player, and alternate game modes.  The alternate game modes include Brawlball, Bombsketball, and other casual game modes.

Gameplay begins with choosing your game mode and then your avatar.  Each hero character has its own unique fighting styles, strengths, and weaknesses.  The character has a strong attack, quick attack, dash, and the ability to throw weapons.  Movement includes 3 in air jumps, the ability to cling and jump up walls, and drop down from ledges.  Each attack type has unique combos that can be discovered through gameplay.  Weapons drop down and usually consist of one quick close in weapon and one heavy weapon.  Though these variations are unique to the player’s avatar.  Your character can use everything from pistols to a grim reaper scythe.  Other one time use weapons also drop for use.

The objectives are to eliminate and or score the most points in a match.  The gameplay is frantic, as 2 to 8 players can be found bouncing across the screen at any given time.  The maps provide unique challenges as you try to either bring the enemies’ health to zero or knock them off the screen.  This is the basic premise of the game.  

The game uses a free to pay model, providing some free characters at the outset.  You are able to gain various in game currency by logging in, winning online matches, meeting achievements, and through in game purchases.  The currency can be spent on new characters, skins, etc.

## Final Thoughts
I gave this game a 6 out of 10.  I enjoyed the graphics, sound effects, and music well enough.  The maps were presented well, and offered different challenges and opportunities.  They have a number of diverse characters, a brief tutorial, and a number of options for gameplay.  Even with all of this to offer, the game boils down to using the same moves over and over to knock people off of ledges.  While this can be enjoyable in 1v1 matches, any more than that and the game can cause camera zoom issues.  It is attempting to keep all the characters in view, which is a challenge during the fast paced action.  Trying to keep track of your character in the midst of a battle was almost headache inducing.  

I found that while there was a diverse cast of characters, the core of the game didn’t change much and left me with little incentive to attempt to unlock other characters, much less attempt to unlock different skins.  In addition to playing the game I had the opportunity to observe the game at PAX South during developer vs player challenges.  The developers have tapped into some of the same love that Super Smash Bros created, but it just doesn’t provide enough excitement to dethrone its predecessor.  The best thing about the game is its price.

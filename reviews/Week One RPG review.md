## Summary
Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a computer role-playing game designed by Owlcat Games using the Pathfinder rules system.  This rules system was developed based on feedback from Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 and 4.0.  For those who are veterans of the CRPG genre, the game immediately brings back memories of classics such as Baldur’s Gate and Planescape: Torment.  The game is designed to bring in fans of high adventure, kingdom building, and unique characters.  The game promises to support creation of any character you can imagine within the rules system.  Depending on how in depth you want to go, character creation can take quite a while to complete.  Once you have done so, the adventure begins.

At the outset, you join a band of mercenaries who are tasked with liberating and becoming a Baron or Baroness of the, you guessed it, “Stolen Lands.”  It doesn’t take long before the action happens and you get to display your character’s skill set.  You have the chance of obtaining and using new companions, spark new rivalries, and unlock mysteries as you follow the story.  There is quite a bit of story to be had, and interestingly enough, some of them are time sensitive.  As the protagonist, you must decide how you approach problems and in what order to accomplish them.  Your choices have an impact on the story as well as the relationships you build with the non-player characters you meet.  Some of these will join as staunch supporters and companions.  Others may become outspoken against what you are doing or leave.  As companions join your party, you are able to level them up according to your character building tastes.

Eventually, you get the chance to actually rule a Kingdom and you can spend much of your time and effort in exercising your royal power.  The gem in all of this, is how well the game designers allowed for varied approaches to problems.  While the main storyline progresses in a somewhat linear path, how you achieve your goals and the results of your decisions create an atmosphere that is tailored to your chosen gameplay style. 

Even combat allows the player to determine just how they want to win.  The game contains all of the number crunching goodness that many tabletop RPG gamers enjoy in a mostly user friendly fashion.  You can use the ever powerful pause button, then queue up commands for each party member individually.  You control a shared party inventory, and are able to customize what weapons, armor, scrolls, potions, etc. that each party member uses.  Hotbars allow for access to feats, skills, spells, and maneuvers that you can use during combat. Quest journals help to keep you apraised of what you are doing and where you need to go. Saving the game can happen anywhere, and it is highly recommended.

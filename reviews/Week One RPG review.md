## Summary
Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a computer role-playing game designed by Owlcat Games using the Pathfinder rules system.  This rules system was developed based on feedback from Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 and 4.0.  For those who are veterans of the CRPG genre, the game immediately brings back memories of classics such as Baldur’s Gate and Planescape: Torment.  The game is designed to bring in fans of high adventure, kingdom building, and unique character management.  The game promises to support creation of any character you can imagine within the rules system.  Depending on how in depth you want to go, character creation can take quite a while to complete.  Once you have done so, the adventure begins.

At the outset, you join a band of mercenaries who are tasked with liberating and becoming a Baron or Baroness of the, you guessed it, “Stolen Lands.”  It doesn’t take long before the action happens and you get to display your character’s skill set.  You have the chance of obtaining and using new companions, spark new rivalries, and unlock mysteries as you follow the story.  There is quite a bit of story to be had, and interestingly enough, some of them are time sensitive.  As the protagonist, you must decide how you approach problems and in what order to accomplish them.  Your choices have an impact on the story as well as the relationships you build with the non-player characters you meet.  Some of these will join as staunch supporters and companions.  Others may become outspoken against what you are doing or leave.  As companions join your party, you are able to level them up according to your character building tastes.

Eventually, you get the chance to actually rule a Kingdom and you can spend much of your time and effort in exercising your royal power.  The gem in all of this, is how well the game designers allowed for varied approaches to problems.  While the main storyline progresses in a somewhat linear path, how you achieve your goals and the results of your decisions create an atmosphere that is tailored to your chosen gameplay style. Pathfinder: Kingmaker also introduces storybook type mini adventures.  You can think of these as interactive choose your own adventure cutscenes. The outcomes are based on your choices and actual character skills. It is an interesting take and gives the player the feeling that they are writing their own unique story.

Even combat allows the player to determine just how they want to win.  The game contains all of the number crunching goodness that many tabletop RPG gamers enjoy in a mostly user friendly fashion.  The game is not turn based per say, but your initiative does determine the order of actions for you and the enemies.  You can use the ever powerful pause button, then queue up commands for each party member individually.  There are some tactical options using flanking and stealth.  You control a shared party inventory, and are able to customize what weapons, armor, scrolls, potions, etc. that each party member uses.  Hotbars allow for access to feats, skills, spells, and maneuvers that you can use during combat. Quest journals help to keep you apraised of what you are doing and where you need to go. Saving the game can happen anywhere, and it is highly recommended.

## Final Thoughts
I give this game an 8 out of 10.  Owlcat games does a really nice job introducing the Pathfinder ruleset into a computer game.  I was surprised that they were able to get as many character classes implemented as they did, and look forward to seeing more added in the future.  On the downside, the character creation tool is best used with the Pathfinder source resource document website one alt-tab click away.  I would rather the interface to allow you to select feats that are down their prerequisite chain so you can have a better grasp of how to achieve your final character build.  For newcomers to Pathfinder it can be daunting.  The character portraits are really nicely done, but there aren’t enough of them.  Combat flows well and you have all of the typical key commands that those familiar with CRPGs are used to.  I would like to see more options for terrain usage and the ability to run.  I don’t know if the developers thought it was funny or not, but there are plenty of encounters that are not level appropriate in random areas.  The difficulty can spike unexpectedly.  It forces the player to rely on the save button.  Kingdom management can be fun, but sometimes the duration for tasks to be carried out seem a bit too long to give it a better flow.  I liked the companion options and the storyline so far and feel it excels at allowing you to be whatever character you want to be.  The music and sound effects are nicely done. I think this is a fine addition to the CRPG genre and hope to see the developers use player feedback for future installments.

## Summary

Faster Than Light is an indie developed roguelike game that puts you in command of a spaceship and crew.  The closest analogy to the gameplay style is if you were playing a set of Star Trek episodes.  Your ship and crew are on an important mission to deliver information about a Rebel Fleet that is in hot pursuit.  You must travel over multiple sectors, meeting new challenges and adventures as you go along before your final confrontation with the Rebel fleet.

When you begin, you are given the chance to select from different ships and races.  As you progress and unlock certain achievements, you can unlock more ships.  After picking a ship you can customize the crew.  There are 8 races to choose from that include the Humans, Engi, Zoltan, Mantis, Rock, Slug, Lanius, and Crystal.  Each race has their own unique benefits and weaknesses.  The Engi are great at repair but not very good in a fight.  The Mantis are great combatants, fast, but aren’t as technically savvy.

Your chosen ship and crew comes with its own compliment of weaponry, systems, and resources.  It is your job to traverse the 8 sectors by choosing your path.  All the while you are being pursued by the Rebel Fleet.  Along the way you have the opportunity to engage in unique missions and environments.  You may enter an asteroid field with an enemy combatant.  Do you stay and fight while getting hammered by giant space rocks or do you try to make your jump to escape as soon as possible?

Thankfully the game allows you to pause.  You must choose how you allocate the energy your ship has, where crewmembers operate, and how to address issues.  For example, if you have a crewmember man the guns, your weapon recharge quicker and accuracy gets a boost. You select the weapon you want to fire and then target the ship.  There are different strategies you can come up with, but taking on the shields seems like a good start.  If a system is yellow it is degraded, and if it is red it is destroyed.  These conditions can be restored over time using crewmembers.  On the receiving end, you can have a hull breech that will leak your oxygen, fires that will spread, and boarding parties that will try to eliminate your crew.  It is your job to manage the crises as they come and make your way successfully through to the Alliance Fleet.


## Final Thoughts
I give this game a 7.5 out of 10.  Subset games produced an entertaining and welcome addition to the roguelike genre.  As a roguelike game, the learning curve is relatively steep.  It comes with a tutorial that teaches you the basics, but fails to discuss how to use the teleporter (a staple of gameplay), drones, etc.  Much of the joy and pain is in trying to figure out what to do.  The replayability of the game is very strong as long as you are patient and don’t mind dying and starting over multiple times.  One strength of the game is that you are able to create your own stories about what happened.  Did your XO die trying to put out the fire? Did you sacrifice one of your crewmembers so that you could get the rest to safety? There are so many options that allow for your imagination to fill in all the necessary blanks.  It would be nice to see this team create a multiplayer mode where you could face off against other real opponents.  The artwork is unique and fitting of the setting.  For roguelike game fans it is many steps above using ASCII characters, but the art still leaves a bit to desire.  The soundtrack and sound effects all make sense and are immersive enough.  The game is a fun sci-fi adventure that keeps you on your toes.  The gameplay is fast and can be unforgiving at times, making Faster Than Light not for the faint at heart.

### Rating
1 to 10, 1 being the worst and 10 the best.

## Summary
Project Rhombus is an indie game created by Psycho Flux Entertainment.  This game falls within the rhythm/music genre of video games.  The game itself is relatively simple, vivid and challenging.  Project Rhombus has 4 game difficulty levels and begins with a tutorial that teaches the player how to anticipate the correct control movements. 

The colors are bright and move along with the beat of the music as do the incoming arrows (>). Your goal is to use the arrow keys on your keyboard to point your (>) in the direction of the closest arrow.  If an arrow gets through the timer stops and it is game over.  There are two forms of arrows, yellow and blue.  The yellow arrows proceed straight towards the center of the screen.  The blue arrows proceed to a point on their approach and then swing 180 degrees out from the other side.  Another challenege is that the arrows can proceed at different speeds and may accelerate or decelerate on their approach. Timing is everything.  



## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.

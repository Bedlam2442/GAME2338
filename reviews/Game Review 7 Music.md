## Summary
Project Rhombus is an indie game created by Psycho Flux Entertainment.  This game falls within the rhythm/music genre of video games.  The game itself is relatively simple, vivid and challenging.  Project Rhombus has 4 game difficulty levels and begins with a tutorial that teaches the player how to anticipate the correct control movements. 

The colors are bright and move along with the beat of the music as do the incoming arrows (>). Your goal is to use the arrow keys on your keyboard to point your (>) in the direction of the closest arrow.  If an arrow gets through the timer stops and it is game over.  There are two forms of arrows, yellow and blue.  The yellow arrows proceed straight towards the center of the screen.  The blue arrows proceed to a point on their approach and then swing 180 degrees out from the other side.  Another challenege is that the arrows can proceed at different speeds and may accelerate or decelerate on their approach. Timing is everything. 

The designers programmed the music to start at different intervals to keep the mind fresh. The colors in the background move along with the beat and are part of the gameplay.  Project Rhombus is free to play, has steam account achievements, a $0.99 donationware version, discord server, and product support with frequent updates.


## Final Thoughts
I give this game a 6 out of 10.  This project is a great start.  I really like the idea and the simplicity of it all.  The colors are a little bit much and may require a warning for those with photosensitive issues (you can turn off the background color pulsuing but this removes part of the gameplay).  Playing the game on my laptop there seemed to be some latency that did not facilitate keeping up with the fast paced gameplay.  It is possible that using a game controller might be better than using the arrow keys.  

The game's programming should do a better job of coordinating the movements of the arrows with the music.  Also I don't like the fact that the arrows change speed.  I think the game could provide a more sensible challenge by color coding incoming arrows based on their behavior and speed. Maybe a slow arrow is red, the medium speed yellow, and fast green.  The blue arrow that rotates around could come in differing colors to represent speed as well.  The developers could also add other types of patterns to the mix.  I would like to see the ability to play the game to your own music.  Project Rhombus is very difficult and can be frustrating at times. With that in mind, the game still has a lot of potential.

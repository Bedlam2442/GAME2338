**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The rules are very simple. This is a shoot them up game that is endless.  The button scheme uses the normal WASD and mouse control system.  The control scheme differs depending on which ship you choose to use.  Other buttons to launch bombs or special moves are used with B or G and the game tells you what those keys are for the various ships the first time you gain one of the bomb powerups. 

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ The speed power up serves no purpose other than to make the game harder for the player.  When it says speed up, it means everything to include enemy movements.  If this allowed the player to move fast while the enemies were moving slow, that would be a different story, but this serves no purpose except to be a detriment to the player.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ This is a single player game that is relatively well balanced for an old school shooter type. You can be a gunship, fighter, destroyer, corvette, battlecruiser, or interceptor.

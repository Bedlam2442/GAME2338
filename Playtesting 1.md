**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The rules are very simple. This is a shoot them up game that is endless.  The button scheme uses the normal WASD and mouse control system.  The control scheme differs depending on which ship you choose to use.  Other buttons to launch bombs or special moves are used with B or G.  The game tells you what those keys are for the various ships the first time you gain one of the bomb powerups. 

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ The speed power up serves no purpose other than to make the game harder for the player.  When it says speed up, it means everything to include enemy movements.  If this allowed the player to move fast while the enemies were moving slow, that would be a different story, but this serves no purpose except to be a detriment to the player.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ This is a single player game that is relatively well balanced for an old school shooter type. You can be a gunship, fighter, destroyer, corvette, battlecruiser, or interceptor.  The larger ships uses move along the bottom of the screen with keyboard and the mouse is used to direct fire.  The smaller ships fly by moving the mouse around the screen and are faster and nimble.  There are different variations of fire.  The more rapid the firing rate, the less damage each shot does.  Also smaller ships tend to do less damage.  On the other hand larger ships have more powerful weapons but their mobility is limited.  The battlecruiser has the most unique setup as it has point defense batteries that fire wherever you point the crosshairs without hitting the trigger for very light damage at a decent rate.  Its main weapon is a beam cannon that can only fire for so long before draining energy.  The player has to manage these play styles along with their weapon power, shield power, and hull integrity.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ The game seems to be coded to send waves upon waves at the player with some randomness involved. I tested this up to wave 40. Therefore, while there is a scaling of difficulty and such, it doesn't feel like the timing has been completely tailored for the user's experience.  You basically continue to get more upon more waves of enemies, and the biggest trouble you tend to face is when the program spits out a screen full of enemies and enemy fire. 

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_The game mechanics and the theme go hand in hand.  It was nice to be able to pick what style of ship you wanted to fly so that you can find which game mechanics best suits you.  

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ For a free shoot em up game, this was pretty fun.  I think that the game definitely has potential if the developers added a basic story, more diverse environments, and some bosses to fight.  Kudos to them for making this simple game enjoyable.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ There was one bug that I discovered while playing.  It manifested in two ways.  First, if you used a fighter type ship that you moved with the mouse and were firing your weapon while the arrow cursor went off screen, your weapon would continue to fire until you clicked on the fire button again. For the ships that are controlled with the keyboard and the weapons with the mouse, if you are firing the weapon and moved the targeting reticle off the screen it would continue to fire as well. This hampers gameplay because energy management is an integral part of effective play.

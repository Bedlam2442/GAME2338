**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The rules were very understandable.  The initial mission let you experience an alien encounter first hand and provided a tutorial of game commands.  Throughout the game Non-Player Characters would provide guidance for other aspects of the game.  This is important due to the multiple modes of gameplay and strategy: Turn based combat, UFO interception, Nation Panic mediation, Anti-terrorist action, Research and Development, Engineering, and soldier advancement.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ The troop medal system is nice and provides various bonuses to your soldiers.  They are purely an addition and would not ultimately alter gameplay overall.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ The gameplay is balanced and allows the player to determine their approach to a situation.  There are multiple classes to choose from, abilities within those classes, choices for research, etc.  Not every class is an instant win, though there are circumstances that favor each.  The game does an excellent job of providing the player with the means to approach their missions in different ways.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ The timing within the game ramps up quickly and can be quite brutal.  That challenge is part of what helps to keep the game moving forward.  X-COM does turn based strategy right and fits in well with the demographic.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ The mechanics and theme work together well.  Aliens are invading earth, there are alien supporters causing mayhem, panic is growing across the globe, and it is up to you to overcome.  You plan out everything from strategy to the tactical level.  Losing a character who you have played with for a long time stings as the alien challenge grows.  The developers did a fine job synergizing the two.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ I had a huge amount of fun playtesting this game.  This is a game that I could see myself playing for hours.  I will later go back and try different strategies to get to a win.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ The program is relatively problem free.  There were certain times where if I had selected my soldier, performed a move action, then selected a different weapon to use, the in-game movement sphere would dissapear.  The solution would be to advance to the next soldier and then back to the one you selected.

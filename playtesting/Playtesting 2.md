**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The basic gameplay is clear as the game provides tutorial instructions while you explore and through in-game emails/messages from non-player characters (NPCs).  The objectives, how items work, what is most beneficial, etc.  are not as clear.  This is most likely due to the sandbox nature of the game.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ The in game web exchange is unnecessary, though it helps to provide incentive for missions.  The way it works is an NPC contacts you for certain items/slimes, you provide those items in exchange for currency and other useful items.  There is already a market feature in game where you can earn money by collecting slime poop. 

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ The game is targeted for a younger audience and Monomi Park does a good job of providing balanced gameplay.  The collection of slimes and dealing with feral or evil slimes is challenging but not overly so.  There are warnings about dangerous areas with hints on how to deal with the challenges ahead.  

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ The game timing allows for self-paced exploration.  As such there are very little elements restricting that goal other than the dangerous slimes that appear in the evening.  NPCs will petition the player for items to collect within a certain amount of time.  This can be challenging for younger players.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ Your avatar, Beatrix LeBeau, is armed with a vacuum to collect slimes, animals, food, and slime poop.  The platform style mechanics are smooth and work well.  You can create pens, fields for crops, chicken coops, and upgrade your vacuum.  Later gameplay provides you with a jetpack for more exploration.  Everything is thematic and reinforces the core game.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ Initially, the game was entertaining.  However it started to become frustrating after certain events began to occur that made no sense.  One example is that slimes eat chickens, vegetables, and fruit.  When you create a hen house, it has walls around it.  The same goes for the slime pens.  You can spend extra money to increase the height of the walls to prevent the slimes from escaping and from getting into the hen house.  Even after upgrading both to maximum, the slimes would still make it in there and eat up all the chickens you collected.  It made all the work a waste of time.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ One problem I discovered pertained to the shooting mechanic of the vacuum.  You can collected and shoot what you collect.  When my ranch got overrun with slimes due to ineffective walls, I started to shoot them out of the farm.  I noticed that I could shoot the slimes into unlocked areas.  The collision does not allow the slimes to travel in that area so they end up walking on air.  I was able to take a screenshot of this problem that could be replicated.

## Summary
Expendabros is a 2d platformer.  The game is free to play pitting up to 4 players (local multiplayer co-op) into roles straight from an 80's action movie.  The game doesn't hide its roots as even the announcer sounds like a steroid filled action hero.  Your team of action heroes are pitted against a ruthless arms dealer, Conrad Stonebanks, in Eastern Europe.  The  point of the game is to terminate this arms dealer, taking out his ruthless terrorist minions along the way. You can unlock up to 7 members of the Broforce: Bro Caesar, Bro Christmas, Broney Ross, Trent Broser, Bronar Jenson, Broc, and Toll Broad.

Your quest begins when you are thrust into battle immediately.  WASD keys are your modes of movement, and you have a key assigned for the primary weapon, special move, and knife attack. The action is quick paced and death can come fast and furious.  The terrain can be destroyed both by primary weapon usage and special weapon usage.  You can jump and climb up the side of a wall using your knife, climb up and down ladders, shimmy across wires, etc.  One of the biggest challenges is being able to recognize all of the things that can kill you.  Boxes, tanks, and all sorts of obstacles can explode or do worse.  It is fun to figure out all the different ways to kill your opponents, but much of your time will be spent starting over due to inadvertently taking yourself out. 

As you progress over the course of many deaths, you come across cages that contain your partners.  Opening and releasing these characters unlock more team members and actually automatically changes your character.  This gives players a chance to master all of the various styles of combat.  The approach is very diverse.  One character uses 2 pistols to lay down a lot of heat in a limited distance, another tosses sticky grenades, another uses a shotgun flamethrower, a melee machete using character, etc.  For the most part, the terrorists you face are relatively easy.  The biggest challenge is facing off against a mechanized creation that will more times than not kill you outright.  

## Final Thoughts
I gave this title 6 out of 10.  The premise is fun enough, the sound effects fine, and the pixelated art is aesthetically pleasing (though no real changes in color pallet).  The game's Bro announcer is fun at first, but with all of the times you end up dying, makes you want to turn the volume down.  The forced change of characters at the cage release spots make you second guess whether or not you want to release them in the first place if you are using a character you are comfortable with. The terrain is destroyable, but there are no hidden caches, rooms, or whatnot that I was able to find during my playtesting.  That feature seems to be there just to allow for more mayhem and little else.  You can actually hurt your progress by destroying too much.  The machete using character is mostly unusable as the threats tend to favor ranged weapon solutions, especially the boss fights.  You die again and again and again mostly from the overabundance of explosions preventing you from seeing the threat coming your way.  As a free to play diversion of a game, this is great.  However, it is not one that I can see myself playing over and over.  As a side note, I was unable to test this out in co-op which may make improve the replayability value.
